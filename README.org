* cwrap -- Wrap C functions for C++17
** Background
   This is derived from the presentation: “How to Call
   C libraries from C++” by Lisa Lippincott, whom
   created this in 2014. Her original video can be
   found at:

   Since she basically did this as a "demo" and does
   not plan to maintain it, I have forked it so that I
   can use it in ZuseNEAT:

   This is modernized for C++17, and perhaps to better
   suit my specific needs, but should be useful to
   everyone.
